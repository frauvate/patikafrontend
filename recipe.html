            <h3>ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>one and a half cups of strawberries</li>
                <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
                <li>one and a half cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix strawberries, honey, sugar, and lemon juice. Allow to sit 15-20 minutes, or until the strawberries have released their juices.</li>
                <li>Mash the mixture with a potato masher, fork, or pastry cutter until there are no longer any large strawberry pieces (if you prefer a smooth ice cream, use a blender or food processor instead*).</li>
                <li>To the strawberries, mix heavy cream, half and half, and vanilla extract. Stir just until combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker, and follow your manufacturer's instructions (mine took about 15-20 minutes to churn). You can eat the ice cream soft-serve, or freeze it in an airtight container for 3-4 hours to thicken it up slightly. For best results, allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes to soften before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
